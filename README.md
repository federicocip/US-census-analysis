# US-census-analysis
The aim of the analysis contained in the notebook is to derive a model to characterise people earning more or less than 50000$ per year, based on the US census data. This is a classification problem where the target is binary and specifically:
- 0 means "earning less than 50000$ per year"
- 1 means "earning more than 50000$ per year"

The data contained in the dataset have been explored and pre-processed in order to get a dataset ready to use for model training.
Two different classifiers have been tested: Logistic Regression classifier and a Random Forest classifier.
Comments and conclusions are all contained in the notebook in this repository.
